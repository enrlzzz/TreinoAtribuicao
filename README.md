# Integer Division and Type Assignment

This repository contains a basic Java program that is an excellent example for understanding a crucial concept: **how Java handles integer division**. The code divides two integer variables (`a` and `b`) and assigns the result to a `double` variable.

A key learning point is that when an operation is performed between two integer types, the result will also be an integer, with any decimal part being truncated. This truncated integer value is then assigned to the `double` variable, which is why the final output is `2.0` instead of `2.5`.
